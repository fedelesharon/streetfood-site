STREETFOOD WEBSITE

This is a project for my street food site. It contains some foods and some a lot more.

This project was made up of the following;

          a. HTML
          b. CSS
In order to run this you need to have a Windows machine
I have managed all these with the help of visual studio code and I've deployed it on the GitHub pages.
